This is the preamble, which can contain contributor information. For this book example, I am here mentioning that I have copied information directly from several Web sites that are hosted by asciidoctor.org and devoted to providing Asciidoc/Asciidoctor documentation. Graphics used are either explicitly available for free, are property of RISC-V International, or were created using Wavedrom.
