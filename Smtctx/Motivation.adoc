== Motivation

The major goal of M-mode trusted context extension is to offer a way for trusted OSes/Services/Drivers to run on M-mode, isolated from the secure monitor/firmware and from each-other, on M/U-only systems.


*Threat model*: Having all those elements running at the highest privilege together with the secure monitor, without memory isolation between them, increases the attack surface of the system.
Also some or all of these elements may be 3rd party proprietary binaries, outside the vendor's control / trust domain. On a system with S-mode available weâ€™d have the secure monitor on M-mode and those elements on S-mode but on an M/U-only system we are constrained and have to come up with another solution.
