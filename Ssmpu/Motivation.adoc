We propose MPU (RISC-V Memory Protection Unit) to provide isolation when paged virtual memory system is not available.

RISC-V based processors recently stimulate great interest in the emerging internet of things (IoT). However, as the paged virtual memory system is usually not available on IoT devices, it is hard to isolate the S-mode OSes (e.g., RTOS) and user-mode applications. To support secure processing and isolate faults of U-mode software, it is desirable to enable S-mode OS to limit the physical addresses accessible by U-mode software on a hart.
