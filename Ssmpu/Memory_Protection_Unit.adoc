== S-mode Memory Protection Unit (SMPU)

An optional RISC-V S-mode Memory Protection Unit (SMPU) provides per-hart supervisor-mode control registers to allow physical memory access privileges (read, write, execute) to be specified for each physical memory region.
The SMPU is checked before the PMA checks and PMP checks, the same as paged virtual memory system (abbr. Sv).

Like PMP, the granularity of SMPU access control settings are platform-specific and within a platform may vary by physical memory region, but the standard SMPU encoding should support regions as small as four bytes. 

SMPU checks will be applied to all accesses for both U mode and S mode, depending on the values in the configuration registers.
M-mode accesses are not affected and always pass SMPU permission checks.
SMPU registers can always be modified by M-mode and S-mode software. SMPU registers can grant permissions to U-mode, which has none by default, and revoke permissions from S-mode, which has all permissions allowed through PMP/ePMP by default.

[NOTE]
====
We use the term, Sv, to represent paged virtual memory system.
====

=== Requirements

1) S mode should be implemented


=== S-mode Memory Protection Unit CSRs

Like PMP, SMPU entries are described by an 8-bit configuration register and one XLEN-bit address register. Some SMPU settings additionally use the address register associated with the preceding SMPU entry. The number of SMPU entries can vary by implementation, and up to 64 SMPU entries are supported in standard.

[NOTE]
====
The terms, entry and rule, are similar to ePMP.
====

The SMPU configuration registers are packed into CSRs in the same way as PMP does. For RV32, 16 CSRs, smpucfg0-smpucfg15, hold the configurations smpu0cfg-smpu63cfg for the 64 SMPU entries.
For RV64, even numbered CSRs (i.e., smpucfg0, smpucfg2, ..., smpucfg14) hold the configurations for the 64 SMPU entries; odd numbered CSRs (e.g., smpucfg1) are illegal.
Figure 2 and 3 demonstrate the first 16 entries of SMPU, the layout of rest entries is similar.

image::RV64_MPU_configuration_CSR_layout.png[title="RV64 SMPU configuration CSR layout"]

The SMPU address registers are CSRs named smpuaddr0-smpuaddr63.
Each SMPU address register encodes bits 33-2 of 34-bit physical address for RV32, as shown in Figure 4.
For RV64, each SMPU address encodes bits 55–2 of a 56-bit physical address, as shown in Figure 5.
Fewer address bits may be implemented for specific reasons, e.g., systems have a smaller physical address space.
Implemented address bits must be contiguous and have to go from lower to higher bits.

The layout of SMPU configuration registers is the same as PMP configuration registers, as is shown in Figure 6. The whole register is WARL.

. The S bit marks a rule as *S-mode-only* when set and *U-mode-only* when unset.
The encoding of ``smpucfg.RW=01``, and the encoding ``smpucfg.SRWX=1111``, now encode a Shared-Region.
The rules and encodings for permission are explained in section 2.4, which resembles the encoding of ePMP (except SMPU doesn't use locked rules).

. Bit 5 and 6 are reserved for future use.

. The A bit will be described in the following sections (2.3).

. The R/W/X bits control read, write, and instruction execution permissions.

*The number of SMPU entries*: The proposal allows 64 SMPU entries, which can provide 64 isolated regions concurrently. To provide more isolation regions, the software in S-mode (usually an OS) can virtualize more isolated regions and schedule them by switching the values in SMPU entries.

*The reset state*: On system reset, the A field of smpu[i]cfg should be zero.



=== Address Matching

The A field in an SMPU entry’s configuration register encodes the address-matching mode of the associated SMPU address register.
It is the same as PMP/ePMP.

=== Encoding of Permissions


SMPU has three kinds of rules: *U-mode-only*, *S-mode-only*, and *Shared-Region* rules.
The S bit marks a rule as *S-mode-only* when set and *U-mode-only* when unset.
The encoding ``smpucfg.RW=01`` encodes a Shared-Region and ``smpucfg.SRWX=1000`` is reserved for future standard use.

. An _S-mode-only_ rule is *enforced* on Supervisor mode and *denied* on User mode.
+
. A _U-mode-only_ rule is *enforced* on User modes and *denied*/*enforced* on Supervisor mode depending on the value of ``sstatus.SUM`` bit:
+
* If ``sstatus.SUM`` is set, a U-mode-only rule is enforced yet without code execution permission on Supervisor mode in order to ensure SMEP.
+
* If ``sstatus.SUM`` is unset, a U-mode-only rule is denied on Supervisor mode.
+
. A _Shared-Region_ rule is enforced on both Supervisor and User modes, with restrictions depending on the ``smpucfg.S`` and ``smpucfg.X`` bits:
+
* If ``smpucfg.S`` is not set the region can be used for sharing data between S-mode and U-mode so is not executable. S-mode has RW access to that region and U-mode has read-only access if ``smpucfg.X`` is not set, or RW access if ``smpucfg.X`` is set.
+
* If ``smpucfg.S`` is set the region can be used for sharing code between S-mode and U-mode so is not writeable. Both S-mode and U-mode have execute access on the region and S-mode may also have read access if ``smpucfg.X`` is set.
+
* The encoding ``smpucfg.SRWX=1111`` can be used for sharing data between S-mode and U mode, where both modes only have read-only access to the region.


The encoding and results are shown in the table:

**SUM bit**: We re-use the sstatus.SUM (allow Supervisor User Memory access) bit to modify the privilege with which S-mode loads and stores access physical memory. The semantics of SUM in SMPU is consistent with it in Sv.


=== Priority and Matching Logic
M-mode accesses are always considered to pass SMPU checks.
If PMP/ePMP is implemented, then accesses succeed only if both PMP/ePMP and SMPU permission checks pass.


Like PMP entries, SMPU entries are also statically prioritized. The lowest-numbered SMPU entry that matches any byte of an access (indicated by an address and the accessed length) determines whether that access is allowed or fails. The matching SMPU entry must match all bytes of an access, or the access fails, irrespective of the S, R, W, and X bits.

1. If the privilege mode of the access is M, the access is allowed;
2. If the privilege mode of the access is S and no SMPU entry matches, the access is allowed;
3. If the privilege mode of the access is U and no SMPU entry matches, but at least one SMPU entry is implemented, the access fails;
4. Otherwise, the access is checked according to the permission bits in the matching SMPU entry and is allowed only if it satisfies the permission checking with the S, R, W, or X bit corresponding to the access type.

=== SMPU and Paging (Sv)
The table below shows which mechanism to use. (Assume both Sv and SMPU are implemented.)

[cols="^1,^1", stripes=even, options="header"]
|===
|satp|Isolation mechanism
|satp.mode == Bare|SMPU only
|satp.mode != Bare|Sv only
|===

We do not allow both SMPU and Sv permissions active at the same time now because:
(1) It will introduce one more layer to check permission for each memory access. This issue will be more serious for guest OS which may have host SMPU and guest SMPU.
(2) Sv can provide sufficient protection.

That means, SMPU is enabled when `satp.mode==Bare` and  SMPU is implemented.


[NOTE]
====
If Sv is not implemented, or when it is disabled, memory accesses check the SMPU settings synchronously, so no fence is needed.
====

=== Exceptions
Failed accesses generate an exception. SMPU follows the strategy that uses different exception codes for different cases, i.e., load, store/AMO, instruction faults for memory load, memory store/AMO and instruction fetch respectively.

The SMPU reuses exception codes of page fault for SMPU fault.
This is because page fault is typically delegated to S-mode, and so does SMPU, so we can benefit from reusing page fault.
S-mode software(i.e., OS) can distinguish page fault from SMPU fault by checking satp.mode (as mentioned in 2.6, SMPU and Sv will not be activated simultaneously).
The *SMPU is proposing to rename page fault to SMPU/Sv fault for clarity*.

Note that a single instruction may generate multiple accesses, which may not be mutually atomic. 

Table of renamed exception codes:

[cols="^1,^1,^1", stripes=even, options="header"]
|===
|Interrupt|Exception Code|Description
|0|12|Instruction SMPU/Sv fault
|0|13|Load SMPU/Sv fault
|0|15|Store/AMO SMPU/Sv fault
|===

[NOTE]
====
You can refer to the Table 3.6 in riscv-privileged spec.
====

*Delegation*: Unlike PMP which uses access faults for violations, SMPU uses SMPU/Sv faults for violations. The benefit of using SMPU/Sv faults is that we can delegate the violations caused by SMPU to S-mode, while the access violations caused by PMP can still be handled by machine mode.



=== Context Switching Optimization
With SMPU, each context switch requires the OS to store 64 address registers and 8 configuration registers (RV64), which is costly and unnecessary.
So the SMPU is proposing an optimization to minimize the overhead caused by context switching.

We add two CSRs called *_smpuswitch0_* and *_smpuswitch1_*, which are XLEN-bit read/write registers, formatted as shown in Figure 7.
For RV64, only *_smpuswitch0_* is used.
Each bit of this register holds on/off status of the corresponding SMPU entry respectively.
During context switch, the OS can simply store and restore smpuswitch as part of the context.
An SMPU entry is activated only when both corresponding bits in smpuswitch and A field of smpuicfg are set. (i.e., smpuswitch[i] & smpu[i]cfg.A)
