== Interaction with other proposals

This section discusses how SMPU interacts with other proposals.

*RISC-V PMP enhancements (version: 0.9.4)*: SMPU is compatible with ePMP proposal, and uses almost the same encoding as ePMP.

*J-extension pointer masking proposal (version: v0.1-draft)*: When both PM and SMPU are used, SMPU checking should be performed using the actual addresses generated by PM (pointer masking).
